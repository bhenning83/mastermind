This is a recreation of the classes Mastermind game that you can play in the terminal. 

After writing the game, I was then challenged to modify it so the user can choose to play as either the code breaker (default gameplay) or the Mastermind.

Retooling my methods and classes was one of my first revelations into the power of OOP. 

It's messier than I would like, but this is by far the most complex program I've written to date. 

I'm planning on adding some artificial intelligence so the computer isn't just making random guesses when the user is playing as the Mastermind.
